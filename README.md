### Tech Stacks

1. React + Vite with PWA (installable)\
   For fast development i'm using react+vite since vite no need to build in dev mode (only works in modern browser), and smaller bundle size.
   i'm also implement PWA so user can install it and use this app in offline mode since this app no backend.

   Using react-router-dom really helpful to ease navigating and routing of the app.
3. react-hook-form\
   Make form easy to build and maintain
4. framer-motion\
   To make the app more smooth with animation
5. jotai\
